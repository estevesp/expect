Desc.: Simple script to seed the current user SSH Key session ID among a list of host-names to be provided within a txt file. Password is also to be provided within a txt file. 

Support script: install_ssh_key.sh

Usage: ./install_ssh_key_wrapper.sh <host_names_file.txt> <password_file.txt>

Future Realeases:

- Currently the script doesn't check if the SSH key is already added 
- Add log functionality

Thanks ;)
